Goodreads Link: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13470.Think_on_These_Things?from_search=true 

This is a personal writing project cum sincere study of the 'things' which J krishnamurti wants every seeker to think about.
Along with that it is also a test of Will. That whether i am capable of taking such a big initiative and take it towards the end.

What idea gave birth to this project is a bit of a long story to be put into the README, and therefore has been moved to the Introduction of this project.
The basic idea is as following:-
1. Before reading the topic from Krishnamurti's book, think about that topic.
2. Whatever interpretation, thoughts and learnings i have from my life about that topic, i have to write it first.
3. Then reading (more of studying) what J (Krishnamurti) has to say about that.
4. After that i need to write my understanding about the topic post-reading and whatever extra i need to add about that topic.
