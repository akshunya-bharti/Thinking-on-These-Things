Yesterday, I was reading the book ‘The Way of Zen’ by Alan Watts. I am now done with about one fifth of it, and I must say that it has been a very enriching experience reading it.

As it often happens while reading the work of a great writer, you start looking at the same things in a different way, and this book was no exception. This is another reason why i think every individual must read, because it frees you up from the rut of same observations about the world around us, and offers a fresh perspective to look at things.

One interesting thing that i noticed in his book is that he has hugely criticized the human language and its limited constructs, due to which how incapable it is in telling the truth. One example that i remember is the one in which he tells how simple it is to show how to tie a shoe lace, but now try to explain it in words!  And this is just one example, he explains beautifully to make you realize that it is not always the case that whatsoever can't be explained is not truth. 

What inspired me on reading his book is his clarity of mind. I imagined how it might feel like to put down your thoughts in writing. Since i have almost negligible experience of writing, i can't directly relate to it.
However i play a lot of music and drawing a parallel between the two forms of art, i know how fulfilling it is when you play a set of notes and they fall into a perfect rhythm and harmony. It might be the same thing for any writer i guess, whenever he or she is able to 'effortlessly' write something meaningful and beautiful. I am looking out for the same fulfillment. 

In my limited experience about writing (mostly trying to write) i have realized a few things.

One is that you need to drop all expectations about producing a great artwork and instead keep producing the art, until it starts approaching the perfection you want it to have. So the first key is keep doing it to keep improving it.

Secondly, you need to be brutally honest while writing. You can not hide yourself and express yourself at the same time. Whatsoever is lurking there in the dark corners of your consciousness, howsoever embarrassing it is (mostly in the eyes of society) it must be brought out.

Thirdly, you need to read a lot to write. As said by G. Polya in his book 'How to Solve it', every kind of learning involves - during initial stages - a lot of imitation. And there is nothing bad about it, because in a way everything is an imitation just slightly modified here and there to be able to correctly express our very own experiences.

Fourth one is that you can't simply start writing one day and expect a story or structure to emerge on that very day. You must set a direction and discover the path as you start treading it. So, you must always decide *what you are going to write about* before you start writing. Once there is a direction your writing slowly starts taking a form and structure.

<ins>So to summarize the 4 points:</ins>

 - Drop all expectations 
 - Be brutally honest 
 - Read to Write 
 - Follow a direction

Now, to follow the last point i have decided to start a writing project for myself. I have decided that i will choose a list of topics and and will start writing on them at a regular basis one after the another.

But from where to pick these topics?

To get the most out of this exercise i have decided to combine reading also with it. So the idea is like this:-
Take a topic, firstly write about it completely from your own experience, then read the understanding of the same topic by someone from whom you can learn and gather more insights, and finally write whatsoever you have learnt after reading which you want to carry in your life.

Now, who can that person be from whom can learn and who can simulate my intellect as well! I have chose J. Krishnamurti and his book 'Think on these things'.

So now let's start thinking on these things.
