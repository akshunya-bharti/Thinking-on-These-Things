#THE FUNCTION OF EDUCATION

There comes a moment in your life when you realize, all that you know is almost nothing in comparison to all that is there to know. You also realize that there is no one on this planet who knows everything. It is then, and only then that you start sharing your knowledge with others in the real sense. Only when you know that sharing it with others is not going to make you lose something does it become playful, i.e. the sharing of knowledge with others becomes playful.
We may come across this moment again and again but we tend to overlook its truth because of our own ego which blinds us and tells us that knowledge is a way of showing your superiority over others. Since you know, you are superior than others, the ones who do not know. Under the spell of ego you will share, but never whole heartedly. The shared knowledge will always be a small part of what you know, a part that is enough to show your superioity without making the knowledge completely accessible to others.
Most of the education that is being imparted in the world belongs to the latter category. Students know less than teachers, agreed. But is this difference greater than what a teacher knows and what all there is to know?
This is the first reason that makes education dull and takes the joy out of learning.

The other reason is even more fatal than the first one. 
Eductaion has been made limited to only making people employable and the whole effort is made towards this goal which gives birth to the disease called competetion. It is strange how closely related are these two reasons.
We make students compete against each other, only to entitle them with the feeling of superiority over their fellow mates as if by knowing a bit more than others is actually going to make you a knowledgeble person. Think again, what little you know more than the other person, is that difference greater than what you know and what all there is to know?
True education should make us humble. However it is so strange that the people who are seen as successful in the eyes of society are the ones who after beating the cut throat competetion are instilled with this feeling of superiority and far from being humble, are totally blinded by their own little knowledge.



**Brainstorming**

 - At the most basic sense education must be about sharing whatever you know with others in order to help them lead their lives in a better way.
 - It should NOT be limited to only making you employable.
 - Currently we think that sending our children to schools is enough and we are done with our duties for shaping their lives. Which of course it is not. We should probably reduce the time spent in schools and make it clear that it only serves a part of the complete development of human being.
 - What every person must know at the very basic level:-
	 1. A Language so that he can communicate with others properly and understand the ideas from around the world.
	 2. Ability to learn anything. What forms the crux of learning anything: Reading, Understanding, asking right questions, practice (in case of a skill), giving enough time to sink in.
	 Anyone from anywhere can learn anything. If we can make someone realize this thing, it is enough to create a revolution in how we perceive education.
